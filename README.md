This node application is built with the view to simplify and robust the process of event registeration.

THe steps to register for the event are:
* Register on the register page with username, email-id and password.
* Login with the user-id and password.
* The User Home Page will show the message of successfull registeration along with the bar code which can be scanned.
* The bar code contains information about user's name.
* A mail is also sent to the registerd email with the barcode.

* Disable Registeration based after a fixed number of registeration.
